# Hi there 👋

> I’m Luca Mainini, a `Mathematical Engineering student` at Politecnico di Milano (Milan, IT) and CentraleSupélec (Paris Region, FR)

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science's degree in Mathematical Engineering, with emphasis on Statistical and Machine Learning. I studied at CentraleSupélec - Université Paris-Saclay between 2019 and 2021 under an international Double Degree program. Before this, I completed my bachelor's degree at Polimi in the field of Mathematical Engineering.

- 👀 I’m interested in Applied Statistics, Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- 🌱 I’m currently working as Credit Risk Analyst intern at American Express
- 🌍 I love travelling and learning new languages
